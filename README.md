# Activity Overview

This project focuses on evaluating potential security risks to a commercial bank's key asset—its funds—by applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. You analyzed vulnerabilities, assigned risk scores, and used these insights to prioritize threat mitigation strategies. This practice activity demonstrates how likelihood and impact combine to determine overall risk severity.

## What’s Included

- Operational Environment Summary  
- Risk Notes contextualizing threats  
- Likelihood scores for five risks  
- Severity scores showing impact level  
- Priority scores calculated using `Likelihood × Severity`

##  Risk Assessment Activity: Commercial Bank Scenario
You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.

| **Asset** | **Risk(s)**                  | **Description**                                              | **Likelihood (1–3)** | **Severity (1–3)** | **Priority (L × S)** |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Funds    | Business email compromise     | An employee is tricked into sharing confidential information. | 2                    | 3                  | 6                     |
| Funds    | Compromised user database     | Customer data is poorly encrypted.                           | 2                    | 2                  | 4                     |
| Funds    | Financial records leak        | A database server of backed-up data is publicly accessible.  | 3                    | 3                  | 9                     |
| Funds    | Theft                         | The bank's safe is left unlocked.                            | 1                    | 3                  | 3                     |
| Funds    | Supply chain disruption       | Delivery delays due to natural disasters.                    | 1                    | 1                  | 1                     |

## Risk Notes

Even though the risks are known, that alone is not enough to prevent malicious actors from exploiting weak points. Active controls—such as continuous monitoring and regular security updates—are essential to stay ahead of evolving threats within the bank's operational environment.

## Reflection
This activity gave me hands-on experience assessing risk in a high-stakes financial environment. Applying contextual classifications to asset vulnerabilities helped solidify my understanding of how threat likelihood and severity combine to shape security priorities. It also highlighted the importance of structured documentation when communicating risk strategies within professional cybersecurity frameworks.
